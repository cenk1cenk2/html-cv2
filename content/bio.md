**Hello, I am Cenk.** [^1]

I am a mostly backend and developer operations software engineer, who is always open to set sail to new adventures. Albeit I have trained to be an engineer, I was mostly doing software-related stuff in my free time, initially by managing servers and creating random services to solve my own problems starting from early age, and after that I have decided to move to Vienna, I realized that I will be a complete person if I pursue programming as a career.

I am the guy that might have one too many servers at home according to my wife and running complex setups that mostly serve me. But the plus side to that is I have big enough of a playground to experiment with new technologies as well as sharpening my skill-set to have a solution for novelty cases when I encounter them in real-life.

I am pretty inclined on virtualization technologies, mostly using Proxmox these days and ESXi, KVM before, to deploy my home servers. Docker has been a lifesaver since I early-adapted it, and the next eye-opening moment came with Puppet where I realized I can automatically provision my servers instead of custom scripts, even though I currently use Ansible for everything today.

Today I am at a peaceful point for my own setup where everything is built with CI/CD, deployed via containers, provision new servers with ease, move around services easily through backups and this makes me ever so restless to improve upon it!

I have more leaned on to microservices instead of serverless architecture and try to adapt that wherever I can. Microservices also coincides with the fact that I want to always split code into smaller reproducible chunks and have the never-so reproducible utopia of having smaller packages that I can use anywhere.

Wherever there is an open-source alternative for software, I will as most of you will choose that over a closed-source software. My mentality is to help with open-source projects whenever I can, eventhough mostly I can not. Because I am aware that even a small thing like a bug report is very helpful to a developer to keep their projects going.

One of the most important things in software for me is resource usage. I strictly do not like software that uses too many resources at idle, even though that contradicts my current main programming language which is JavaScript/TypeScript which I can argue that it is fast to prototype with. I am fully aware that every programming language has its place in the community and its performance will depend on the context and time constraints. Therefore I love the opportunities where I find to work and learn about any other programming language and move out of my usual comfort zone and ecosystem.

One of the joys of my life is to discuss this "nerdy" stuff with like-minded people and exchange ideas even though according to my experience they are rarer than unicorns.
